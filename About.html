        </u></i></b><p>A chief executive officer (CEO),[1] or just chief executive (CE), is the most senior corporate, executive, or administrative officer in charge of managing an organization â€“ especially an independent legal entity such as a company or nonprofit institution. CEOs lead a range of organizations, including public and private corporations, non-profit organizations and even some government organizations (notably Crown corporations). The CEO of a corporation or company typically reports to the board of directors and is charged with maximizing the value of the entity,[1] which may include maximizing the share price, market share, revenues or another element. In the non-profit and government sector, CEOs typically aim at achieving outcomes related to the organization's mission, such as reducing poverty, increasing literacy, etc.

        In the early 21st century, top executives typically have technical degrees in science, management, engineering or law.[2]</p>
